# EscapeGame
===

Escape game developed live on [twitch.tv/mikezenith](https://twitch.tv/mikezenith).

I recommend using VSCode for this projects to have the same set up as you can see on stream. Please find the used extensions in `.vscode` directory or use `View\Extensions CTRL(CMD)+Shift+X` and type `@recommended` in the search bar.

# SetUp

- Install node.js (check version @[package.json#engines.node](https://github.com/mikezenith/escape/blob/master/package.json)`)
- Install yarn
- Run `yarn install`
